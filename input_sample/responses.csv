question_1: How was your food?,question_2: When did you visit the restaurant?,question_3: Where could we improve?
It was super good.,2.3.2023,I think the food tasted good and everything was nice but it was a bit noisy inside because of all the kids. A separate play area or fewer tables inside would be good.
"great, thank you!",august,"I was a bit disappointed at the pizza, it wasn't quite authentic, especially for the price I didn't expect to have the same pizza they serve at fast food restaurants."
there was hair in it!!!!,christmas 2022,It was all good. Maybe the soups could have been a bit bigger portions and the music could have been more christmas-y.
"it was alright, i had better","not sure, sometime last year",All good in my opinion
The pancake was just like how my mom used to make it,26.4.2020 at 9am,"replace fake plants with real ones, add ice cream to the menu"
"The dessert was nice, but the soup was a little bit flavourless",yesterday morning,"I wish the area in front of the restaurant was cleaner. I know it's a busy area but it wasn't nice outside. The waiter was a bit rude as well, but nothing crazy"
"It was all okay, just the portion size was a bit sad",I think late june or early july in 2023,Like I said the portion size wasn't great. The music was not fitting the overall mood of the place
10/10,"First in april then also once in may ","It would be nice to have student discount, but the food was good"
The kids were happy,Halloween,Should have kids meals
It was okay,We come every time in spring break,"Stop raising the prices! Also, the toilet was a bit dirty"
